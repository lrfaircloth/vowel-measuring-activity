# vowel-measuring-activity
An in-class activity (suitable for intro, can be adapted for upper-level ie phonetics)

This zip file contains: a sample .csv file, in-class student directions, lecture notes, and an R project. 

The student directions have two parts. The first part tells them how to download praat and record a list of minimal pairs. 
I have them do this at home before they come to class. The second part tells them how to measure and plot F1 and F2 
from their own speech. I have them do this in class. 

The R-project contains an R script that allows you to plot the vowels for a class. It goes through a dataframe set up 
like the sample csv file and adds the IPA symbols. There are different plots, such as by vowel (all vowels are the same color),
by person (all vowels from the same person are the same color), and with elipses that show the general distribution of vowels. 
I use these later on in the class, to show how a groupe of people all have different vocal tracts that produce different 
measurements, but are identified as a the same phoneme. Depending on your class, it also works well for illustrating 
dialect variation. 

The lecture notes include a video that I use to explain formants (for intro, for an upper-level class it's part of the 
main material).
